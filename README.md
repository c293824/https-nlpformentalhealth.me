# Natural Language Processing for Mental Health

THE GOAL OF THIS WEBSITE IS TO GENERATE PROJECTS (OR SIMPLY IDEAS AND SAMPLE CODE) TO ASSIST IN CREATING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROJECTS THAT WILL IN SOME WAY ASSIST THE MENTALLY ILL OR MENTALLY DISABLE.  IT IS MY HOPE THAT DISABLED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE STRUGGLED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROJECTS BUT ANY ASSISTANCE IS WELCOME.

IN THE BEGINNING THE GOAL IS COLLECT ANY PAPERS OR PUBLICATIONS CONCERNING THE CURRENT USE OF NLP TO ASSIST THE MENTALLY ILL.

IN ADDITION, PLEASE SUBMIT ANY OF YOUR OWN IDEAS IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE.

THIS PAGE IS CREATED USING GITHUB PAGES FROM https://github.com/c293824/nlpformentalhealth.me/edit/master/ WHERE SUBMISSIONS CAN BE MADE
Thank you for your interest.
